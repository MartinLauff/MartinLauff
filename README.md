- 👋 Hi, I’m @MartinLauff
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development
- 🌱 I’m currently mastering my MERN stack skills

Hello and welcome to my Github profile! I am a maniac in designing and developing extensive web applications. Before starting my bachelor studies in Germany I completed several courses on Udemy and created more than a few projects. The most notable ones are:

### Quizeck
It's a short and entertaining quiz to test your knowledge of Geography. Check out the pinned repository for more!

### StoryTell
This is the project I am most proud of. StoryTell is a social media platform with thoughtful UI and all the essential features for social interaction. After designing and developing for a total of 7 months I finally declared this project to be complete. Apart from receiving praise from my peers, I had a chance to present this website at the university's student club called Open Research Space (see my profile picture).
To learn more about this project follow the pinned repository!
