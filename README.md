## Introduction

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MartinLauff
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Development
- ðŸŒ± I mastered my MERN stack skills

Hello and welcome to my Github profile! I am an enthusiast in developing custom datasets, inovative AI and extensive web applications. In my free time I created more than a few projects. The most notable ones are:

### Billiard Dataset Generation
Here, I developed a pipeline to generate custom datasets depending on whether it's a detection or segmentation task. In the matter of hours, one can generate 10s or thousands of images, segmentation masks and annotations. I also fine-tune a YOLO model for detecting billiard balls and segmenting the billiard area.

### Billiard Game Mapping
In this Jupyter notebook, I am aiming to use an image of a billiard game to map billiard balls from the image to a 2D Top-Down View using Homography.

### StoryTell
This is the project I am most proud of. StoryTell is a social media platform with modern UI and all the essential features for social interaction. After designing and developing for a total of 7 months I finally declared this project to be complete. Apart from receiving praise from my peers, I had the opportunity to showcase this website at the university's student club called Open Research Space (see my profile picture).
